Diabetes Prediction

In this project machine learning is used for the purpose of predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not. This project comprises of the dataset that is used and the python notebook file in which machine learning is performed. K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm is used for classification. The model retrieved an accuracy of 77 percent.

The steps of this project are fetching the data, data visualization, train-test split, standard scaling, and model building.

K-Nearest Neighbors is a classification algorithm that uses the concept of Euclidean Distance to predict the target outcome. The user selects the number of neighbors. In this case the appropriate neighbors are five. Selecting five neighbors gives the lowest error rate. The testing data's distance is calculated using Euclidean Distance with all the neighbors. The neighbor which is found to have the shortest distance with the testing data , the testing data is predicted to be in the same class of that of the particular neighbor.
